## ScriptsForCASTEP

### CalAll



### Convergence

###  Elastic *v2.0*

This script can be used in *Materials Studio* to calculate the 2nd or 3rd elastic constants by using CASTEP.

​      **NOTE:** This script is under develop now. And it only support the cubic crystal now. If you want to implement this script for other crystal, you need to add the deform mode and deduce the coefficients by yourself.

## CryCal *V1.0*

**Function:**  Calculate the angle and distance in crystal (Code in MATLAB)

**Usage:**
      Provide a GUI and help file for use(code comments in chinese)

## StrainStress-Sep *V2.0*

**Function:** Seperate the strain stress data(in two columns) into multi columns(Code in MATLAB)

**Usage:**
          See in the code(code comments in chinese)

## TernaryPlot *V1.1*

**Function**: Plot Ternary figure for ternary system

**Usage:**

​        See in the code.
