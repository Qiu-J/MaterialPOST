# ElasticPOST

**NOTE:** This project has been moved to [here](https://github.com/hitliaomq/ElasticPOST)

This is a software to visualize polycrystalline modulus anisotropy in 3D.

**Function** : To visualize the anisotropy of polycrystalline elastic constants(including bulk modulus(B), Young's modulus(E), shear modulus(G) and Poisson's ratio(*v*)) using elastic stiffness constants.



*Note: Currently, the source is not released for some personal reasons, but it will come soon.(if you are interested in it, please send me an e-mail(liaomq1900127@163.com), I will send to you as soon as possible).
