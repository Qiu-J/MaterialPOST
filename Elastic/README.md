# Elastic *V2.0*

**NOTE: This script is under test now.**

**Function:**

This script can be used in *Materials Studio* to calculate the 2nd or 3rd elastic constants by using CASTEP.

Only for cubic now(For other crystal, it need add the deform mode by your self, and deduce the coefficients by yourself.)
